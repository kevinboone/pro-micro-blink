# Pro Micro Blink

A demonstration of the use of command-line tools to build and
upload executables for the SparkFun Pro Micro microcontroller and 
similar devices. This is relatively easy to do for "raw" C code, 
without the use of the standard Arduino libraries; it's quite fiddly
with libraries because of the complicated dependencies.
